        <p>
          A "tube-style" map that displays information about the Island Explorer
          bus routes in Acadia National Park. The maps have been designed with
          the following in mind:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Quickly see where routes are connected to each other by bus stops so
            that riders can determine which route or routes can get them to
            their destination.
          </li>
          <li>
            The relationships between the paths of routes. This is useful when
            flagging down a bus from a trailhead or another location that does
            not have a designated stop.
          </li>
          <li>
            Minimize the distractions that are caused by maps with routes that
            are overlayed on a geographically accurate depiction where roads
            have turns and switchbacks and important details may be obscured.
          </li>
          <li>
            Provide a list of bus stops with helpful information that includes
            the routes that access the stop, facilities (restrooms, drinking
            water, etc.), and points of interest (trailheads, geographic
            features, etc.).
          </li>
          <li>Fits on a single sheet of letter paper printed on both sides.</li>
        </ul>
