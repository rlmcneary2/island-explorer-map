# island-explorer-map

A "tube-style" map that displays information about the Island Explorer bus
routes in Acadia National Park. The maps have been designed with the following
in mind:

- Quickly see where routes are connected to each other by bus stops so that
  riders can determine which route or routes can get them to their destination.
- The relationships between the paths of routes. This is useful when flagging
  down a bus from a trailhead or another location that does not have a
  designated stop.
- Minimize the distractions that are caused by maps with routes that are
  overlayed on a geographically accurate depiction where roads have turns and
  switchbacks and important details may be obscured.
- Provide a list of bus stops with helpful information that includes the routes
  that access the stop, facilities (restorooms, drinking water, etc.), and
  points of interest (trailheads, geographic features, etc.).
- Fits on a single sheet of letter paper printed on both sides.

The maps and a list of bus stops are stored under directories with names that
correspond to the year they were created for.
